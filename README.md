# Barkley-2D
Barkley model [1] is an example of diffusion-reaction equations, which have wide applications in chemistry, ecology and life sciences. The principal idea is that we model time change of the spatial distribution of two species $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$, which can react with each other and are also diffused in the process. The model is given by
 $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = f(u,v) + \nabla^2 u   $$
 $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = g(u,v) $$
